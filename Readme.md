Random Quotes is a projet in node.js and react.js with TypeScirpt, Apollo and GraphQL.

I have created a function with random adjectives, nouns and adverbs to obtain fakes quotes. In order to create the name of the authors, I have created a function wich links a random name of my classmates with a random lastname of a writer.
